##  Concepts such as polymorphism , Inheritance were covered through examples

The idea behind polymorphism is to work with multiple data types using a single function ! 

Polymorphism exists in two forms  
1. Static Binding (Compile Time)

In Static binding overload concept is utilized to define the function signatures
In Dynamic Binding "Virtual" function is used to achieve the polymorphism.
